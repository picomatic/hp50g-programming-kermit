# hp50g-programming-kermit

## What this set of scripts/ programs does:
~~You can type programs in a normal text editor and send them to your calculator. Now this is work in progress so not everything is implemented. 
Use this a starting point. hp.sh contains the converting engine.~~
I found there already is a file format that does what i want: %%HP: T(3)A(R)F(.);
You can send RPL files to your HP49+ or HP50g.

## Before you start
Some programs (ckermit, bbe) are needed to run the scripts, so before using the hp.sh and sendall.sh, run:
    ./init.sh
